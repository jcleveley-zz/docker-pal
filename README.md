# Docker PAL

This creates a [Docker](http://docker.io) container for the BBC Page Assembly
Layer. If you don't know what the PAL is, you probably don't need this repo.

## Installation

Clone this repo and run: `docker build -t <yourname>/pal .`, this should build
the required container for using the PAL within Docker.

**Note:** You will need a BBC developer certificate which needs to be placed in
the root of this repo as `dev.bbc.co.uk.pem`

This repo would go nicely with my
[vagrant-coreos-docker](https://github.com/sthulb/vagrant-coreos-docker) repo.


## Usage

You can run the resulting image fairly easily with: `docker run -p 22 -p 80 -p
6081 -t -i <yourname>/pal`

It's even possible to run this concurrently with itself.
